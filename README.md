# Overview

The export, import, delete using CSV files scripts in this post, currently version 00.17.25, dated 2017-01-04, are intended to allow operations on an existing R80 or R80.10 Check Point management server (SMS or MDM) from bash on the management server or a management server able authenticate and reach the target management server.


These scripts show examples of:

- an export of objects and services with full and standard json output, and export of hosts, networks, groups, groups-with-exclusion, address-ranges, dns-domains,and group members to csv output [future services dump to csv is pending further research]
- an export of hosts, networks, groups, groups-with-exclusion, address-ranges, dns-domains,and group members to csv output [future services dump to csv is pending further research]
- an import of hosts, networks, groups, groups-with-exclusion, address-ranges, dns-domains,and group members from csv output generated by the export to csv operations above.
- a script to delete groups-with-exclusion, groups, address-ranges, dns-domains, networks,hosts, using csv files created by an object name export to csv for the respective items deleted.  NOTE:  DANGER!, DANGER!, DANGER!  Use at own risk with extreme care!

Description

This post includes a set of four (4) script packages, which can be used independently combined.  All script files end with .sh for shell and are intended for Check Point bash implementation on R80 and R80.10 or later.  Scripts in the packages have specific purposes and some scripts call sub-scripts for extensive repeated operations.  The packages also include specific expected default directory folders that are not created by the script action.

 

The packages are:

- Export Objects :  cli_api_export_objects_ericb_v00x17x25.7z
- Export Specific Objects :  cli_api_export_specific_objects_ericb_v00x17x25.7z

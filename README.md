Check Point R8x Export, Import, [and more] API scripts for bash and powershell

CLI API Example for exporting, importing, and deleting different objects using CSV files (v00.21.00)

For a complete overview, review the PDF - TBD 


# Overview

The export, import, delete using CSV files scripts in this post, currently version 00.21.00, dated 2017-05-25, are intended to allow operations on an existing R80 or R80.10 Check Point management server (SMS or MDM) from bash on the management server or a management server able authenticate and reach the target management server.


These scripts show examples of:

- an export of objects and services with full and standard json output, and export of hosts, networks, groups, groups-with-exclusion, address-ranges, dns-domains,and group members to csv output [future services dump to csv is pending further research]
- an export of hosts, networks, groups, groups-with-exclusion, address-ranges, dns-domains,and group members to csv output [future services dump to csv is pending further research]
- an import of hosts, networks, groups, groups-with-exclusion, address-ranges, dns-domains,and group members from csv output generated by the export to csv operations above.
- a script to delete groups-with-exclusion, groups, address-ranges, dns-domains, networks,hosts, using csv files created by an object name export to csv for the respective items deleted.  NOTE:  DANGER!, DANGER!, DANGER!  Use at own risk with extreme care!
